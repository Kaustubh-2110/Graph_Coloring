# Using Computational Algebraic Geometry for Graph Coloring Problems

This project explores an algebraic approach to solving the NP-complete graph coloring problem. By leveraging computational algebraic geometry, the project aims to efficiently determine the k-colorability of graphs, with a particular focus on chordal graphs.

## Key Features
- **Polynomial Systems**: Implements polynomial equations to represent graph colorability, providing an algebraic perspective on the problem.
- **Gröbner Basis Algorithm**: Develops a custom algorithm to compute Gröbner bases for chordal graphs, offering a polynomial-time solution for specific graph classes.
- **Real-World Applications**: Demonstrates the utility of the approach in practical scenarios, such as scheduling and resource allocation.

## Applications
- **Timetable Scheduling**: Applies graph coloring techniques to avoid scheduling conflicts.
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimizes resource distribution in systems by ensuring non-overlapping allocations.
- **Sudoku Solver**: Uses graph coloring to solve puzzles like Sudoku by ensuring valid number placements.
